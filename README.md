FanFactory
==========

Fan Factory uses a game engine / user interface framework that I created. The game engine is built on box2d and cocos2d and the user interface framework includes layers, scenes, sprites, scroll views, paging views, table views, alert views and more. The user interface is dynamically responsive (i.e it works on any reasonable screen size).



Known Issues:

- Crashes on startup in iOS 9
- Older versions of cocos2D and Box2D do not compile with Xcode's new suggested warnings
- Doesn't use ARC
